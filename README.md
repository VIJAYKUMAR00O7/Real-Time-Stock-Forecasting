**📌 Steps to Set Up the Project:**


**Step 1:** Create GitHub Repository

Go to GitHub and create a new repository named real-time-stock-forecasting.

**Step 2:** Clone Repository to Local

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/VIJAYKUMAR00O7/Real-Time-Stock-Forecasting.git
cd real-time-stock-forecasting


**Step 3:** Add Provided Files into the Structure
Place the uploaded files as follows:

app.py & app-checkpoint.py → streamlit_app/

requirements.txt → repository root

.ipynb (Jupyter notebooks uploaded) → notebooks/

**Step 4:** Create Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate          # Linux/MacOS
myenv\Scripts\activate             # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 5: Run Streamlit Application

bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run streamlit_app/app.py
